<h1>6.830 Lab 5: Rollback and Recovery</h1>

<b>Assigned: May 2 2012</b><br>
<b>Due: May 17 2012</b>

<h2>0. Introduction</h2>

<p>

In this lab you will implement log-based rollback for aborts and
log-based crash recovery. We supply you with the code that defines the
log format and appends records to a log file at appropriate times
during transactions. You will implement rollback and recovery using
the contents of the log file.

<p>
The logging code we provide generates records intended for
physical whole-page undo and
redo. When a page is first read in, our code remembers the original
content of the page as a before-image. When a transaction updates a
page, the corresponding log record contains that remembered
before-image as well as the content of the page after modification as
an after-image. You'll use the before-image to roll back during aborts
and to undo loser transactions during recovery, and the after-image to
redo winners during recovery.

<p>

We are able to get away with doing whole-page physical UNDO (while
ARIES must do logical UNDO) because we are doing page level locking
and because we have no indices which may have a different structure at
UNDO time than when the log was initially written.  The reason
page-level locking simplifies things is that if a transaction modified
a page, it must have had an exclusive lock on it, which means no other
transaction was concurrently modifying it, so we can UNDO changes to
it by just overwriting the whole page.


<p>
Your BufferPool already implements abort by deleting dirty pages, and
pretends to implement atomic commit by forcing dirty pages to disk
only at commit time. Logging allows more flexible buffer management
(STEAL and NO-FORCE), and our test code calls 
<code>BufferPool.flushAllPages()</code>
at certain points in order to exercise that flexibility.

<h2>1. Getting started </h2>

You should begin with the code you submitted for Lab 4 (if you did not
submit code for Lab 4, or your solution didn't work properly, contact us to
discuss options.)

<p>

You'll need to modify some of your existing source and add a few new files. 
Here's what to do:

<ul>

<li>Make a backup of your Lab 4 solution by typing :
<pre>$ tar -cvzf 6.830-lab4-submitted.tar.gz 6.830-lab4</pre>

<li>Rename your lab directory to 6.830-lab5
<pre>
$ mv 6.830-lab4 6.830-lab5
</pre>

<li>Change to the directory that contains your top-level simpledb
code:
<pre>
$ cd 6.830-lab5
</pre>

<li>

Download the new tests and skeleton code for Lab 5 from <a
href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab5-supplement.tar.gz">
http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab5-supplement.tar.gz</a>:
<pre>
$ wget http://db.csail.mit.edu/6.830/assignments/6.830-lab5-supplement.tar.gz
</pre>

<li>Extract the new files for Lab 5 by typing:

<pre>tar -xvzf 6.830-lab5-supplement.tar.gz</pre>

This will not overwrite any existing files, but will just add a new test file 
to the <code>test/simpledb/systemtest</code> directory.
<p>  
<li> Now make the following changes to your existing code:

<ol>

<li><p>
  
Insert the following lines into <code>BufferPool.flushPage()</code> before
your call to <code>writePage(p)</code>, where <code>p</code> is a reference
to the page being written:

<pre>
        // append an update record to the log, with 
        // a before-image and after-image.
        TransactionId dirtier = p.isDirty();
        if (dirtier != null){
          Database.getLogFile().logWrite(dirtier, p.getBeforeImage(), p);
          Database.getLogFile().force();
        }
</pre>
  This causes the logging system to write an update to the log.  
We force the log to ensure
  the log record is on disk before the page is written to disk.
<p>
  
<li>
Your <code>BufferPool.transactionComplete()</code> calls <code>flushPage()
</code> for each page that a committed transaction dirtied. For each such
page, add a call to <code>p.setBeforeImage()</code> after you have flushed
the page:
    
<pre>
        // use current page contents as the before-image
        // for the next transaction that modifies this page.
        p.setBeforeImage();
</pre>

  After an update is committed, a page's before-image needs to be updated
  so that later transactions that abort rollback to this committed version
  of the page.
(Note: We can't just call <code>setBeforeImage()</code> in 
<code>flushPage()</code>, since <code>flushPage()</code>
might be called even if a transaction isn't committing. Our test case actually 
does that! If you implemented
  <code>transactionComplete()</code> by calling <code>flushPages()</code> 
instead, you may need to pass an additional
  argument to <code>flushPages()</code> to tell it whether the flush is being 
  done for a committing transaction or not. However, we strongly suggest 
in this case you simply rewrite
<code>transactionComplete()</code> to use <code>flushPage()</code>.)
<p>

</ol>

<li>After you have made these changes, do a clean build (<tt>ant clean; ant
</tt> from the command line, or a "Clean" from the "Project" menu in Eclipse.)
<p>
<li>At this point your code should pass the first three sub-tests
of the <code>LogTest</code> systemtest, and fail the rest:
<pre>
% ant runsystest -Dtest=LogTest
    ...
    [junit] Running simpledb.systemtest.LogTest
    [junit] Testsuite: simpledb.systemtest.LogTest
    [junit] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 7, Time elapsed: 0.42 sec
    [junit] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 7, Time elapsed: 0.42 sec
    [junit] 
    [junit] Testcase: PatchTest took 0.057 sec
    [junit] Testcase: TestFlushAll took 0.022 sec
    [junit] Testcase: TestCommitCrash took 0.018 sec
    [junit] Testcase: TestAbort took 0.03 sec
    [junit]     Caused an ERROR
    [junit] LogTest: tuple present but shouldn't be
    ...
</pre>

<li>If you don't see the above output from <tt>ant runsystest -Dtest=LogTest</tt>,
something has gone wrong with the un-tarring of
<tt>6.830-lab5-supplement.tar.gz</tt> or the changes you made are somehow
incompatible with your existing code. You should figure out and fix
the problem before proceeding; ask us for help if necessary.
  
</ul>

<h2>2. Rollback</h2>

Read the comments in <code>LogFile.java</code> for a description of 
the log file format.
You should see in <code>LogFile.java</code> a set of functions, such as
<code>logCommit()</code>, that generate each kind of log record and append
it to the log.

<p>
Your first job is to implement the <code>rollback()</code> function in
<code>LogFile.java</code>. This function is called when a transaction aborts,
before the transaction releases its locks. Its job is to un-do any
changes the transaction may have made to the database.

<p> Your <code>rollback()</code> should read the log file, 
find all update records
associated with the aborting transaction, extract the before-image
from each, and write the before-image to the table file.  Use
<code>raf.seek()</code> to move around in the log file, and 
<code>raf.readInt()</code> etc.  to
examine it. Use <code>readPageData()</code> to read each of the before- and
after-images.  You can use the map <code>tidToFirstLogRecord</code> (which maps
from a transaction id to an offset in the heap file) to determine
where to start reading the log file for a particular transaction.
You will need to make sure that you discard any page from the buffer
pool whose before-image you write back to the table file.

<p> As you develop your code, you may find the <code>Logfile.print()</code> 
method useful for displaying the current contents of the log.


<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1: LogFile.rollback()</b>

  <p>
  Implement LogFile.rollback().

  <p>
  After completing this exercise, you should be able to pass the 
  TestAbort and
  TestAbortCommitInterleaved
  sub-tests of the LogTest system test.

</div>

<p>
<h2>3. Recovery</h2>

If the database crashes and then reboots, <code>LogFile.recover()</code> 
will be
called before any new transactions start. Your implementation should:

<ol>

<li>Read the last checkpoint, if any.

<li>Scan forward from the checkpoint (or start of log file, if no checkpoint)
to build the set of loser
transactions. Re-do updates during this pass. You can safely start
re-do at the checkpoint because <code>LogFile.logCheckpoint()</code> 
flushes all dirty buffers to disk.

<li>Un-do the updates of loser transactions.

</ol>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2: LogFile.recover()</b>
<p>

  <p>
  Implement LogFile.recover().

  <p>
  After completing this exercise, you should be able to pass all
  of the LogTest system test.
  

</div>

<h2>4. Logistics </h2>

You must submit your code (see below) as well as a short (1 page, maximum)
writeup describing your approach.  This writeup should:

<ul>

<li> Describe any design decisions you made, including anything that was
difficult or unexpected.

  <li> Discuss and justify any changes you made outside of LogFile.java.

</ul>

<h3>4.1. Collaboration </h3>

This lab should be manageable for a single person, but if you prefer
to work with a partner, this is also OK.  Larger groups are not allowed.
Please indicate clearly who you worked with, if anyone, on your writeup.  

<h3>4.2. Submitting your assignment </h3>

<p>
To submit your code, please create a <tt>6.830-lab5.tar.gz</tt> tarball (such
that, untarred, it creates a <tt>6.830-lab3/src/simpledb</tt> directory with
your code) and submit it for the Lab 5 assigment on the  <a
href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp12/6.830/homework/">Stellar Site Homework Section</a>.
You may submit your code multiple times; we will use the latest version you
submit that arrives before the deadline (before 11:59pm on the due date).  If
applicable, please indicate your partner in your writeup.  Please also submit
your individual writeup as a PDF or plain text file (.txt).  
Please do not submit a .doc or .docx.

<a name="bugs"></a>
<h3>4.3. Submitting a bug </h3>

<p>SimpleDB is a relatively complex piece of code. It is very possible you are going to find bugs, inconsistencies, and bad, outdated, or incorrect documentation, etc.</p>

<p>We ask you, therefore, to do this lab with an adventurous mindset.  Don't get mad if something is not clear, or even wrong; rather, try to figure it out
yourself or send us a friendly email. 
Please submit (friendly!) bug reports to <a
href="mailto:6830-staff@mit.edu">6830-staff@mit.edu</a>.
When you do, please try to include:

<ul>

<li>A description of the bug.

<li>A <tt>.java</tt> file we can drop in the <code>src/simpledb/test</code>
directory, compile, and run.

<li>A <tt>.txt</tt> file with the data that reproduces the bug.  We should be
able to convert it to a <tt>.dat</tt> file using <code>PageEncoder</code>.

</ul>

You can also post on the class page on Piazza if you feel you have run into a bug.

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>4.4 Grading </h3>

<p>50% of your grade will be based on whether or not your code passes the
system test suite we will run over it. These tests will be a superset
of the tests we have provided; the tests we provide are to help guide
your implementation, but they do not define correctness.
Before handing in your code, you should
make sure produces no errors (passes all of the tests) from both
<tt>ant test</tt> and <tt>ant systemtest</tt>.</p>

<p>

<b>Important:</b> Before testing, we will replace your <tt>build.xml</tt>,
<tt>HeapFileEncoder.java</tt>, and the entire contents of the
<tt>test/</tt> directory with our version of these files.  This
means you cannot change the format of the <tt>.dat</tt> files!  You should
also be careful when changing APIs and make sure that any changes you make 
are backwards compatible. In other words, we will
untar your tarball, replace the files mentioned above, compile it, and then
grade it. It will look roughly like this:

<pre>
$ gunzip 6.830-lab5.tar.gz
$ tar xvf 6.830-lab5.tar
$ cd 6.830-lab5
[replace build.xml, HeapFileEncoder.java and test]
$ ant test
$ ant systemtest
[additional tests]
</pre>

If any of these commands fail, we'll be unhappy, and, therefore, so will your grade.

<p>

An additional 50% of your grade will be based on the quality of your
writeup and our subjective evaluation of your code.

<p>

We've had a lot of fun designing this assignment, and we hope you enjoy
hacking on it!
